WinRAR is a popular software that can compress and decompress files in various formats. It is widely used by millions of people around the world for various purposes. However, it can also be used as a tool for hacking Facebook passwords. How? By creating a fake WinRAR file that looks like a legitimate one, but actually contains a hidden payload that can execute a keylogger or a phishing script on the victim's computer.
 
A keylogger is a program that can record every keystroke typed on the keyboard, including passwords, usernames, emails, and other sensitive information. A phishing script is a program that can create a fake Facebook login page that looks identical to the real one, but actually sends the entered data to the hacker's server. Both methods can help you hack Facebook passwords with WinRAR easily and quickly.
 
## Steps to Hack Facebook Passwords with WinRAR
 
To hack Facebook passwords with WinRAR, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a fake WinRAR file that contains your malicious code. You can use any online tool or software that can generate such files, such as [WinRAR Hack](https://www.winrar-hack.com/). You need to enter the name of the file, the icon, the compression level, and the payload type (keylogger or phishing). You can also customize the message that will appear when the victim opens the file.
2. Upload your fake WinRAR file to any file-sharing platform or website, such as [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/). You need to make sure that the file is accessible by anyone who has the link.
3. Send the link of your fake WinRAR file to your target user via email, social media, or any other means. You need to make sure that the link looks convincing and trustworthy. You can use some tricks to make it look more authentic, such as adding some text before or after the link, using a URL shortener service, or disguising it as an image or a video.
4. Wait for your target user to download and open your fake WinRAR file. Once they do that, your malicious code will run on their computer and capture their Facebook login credentials. Depending on your payload type, you will either receive an email with their keystrokes or a link to their fake Facebook login page where they entered their data.
5. Use their Facebook login credentials to access their account and do whatever you want.
